      <p>Scammers are getting better every day. They sound professional, they create urgency, and they know exactly how to make you doubt yourself.</p>

      <p>This site exists to give you a quick, calm way to check if something was a scam — and to know what to do next. No jargon, no judgment, just clear answers.</p>

      <h2>Why this site exists</h2>
      <p>Too many good people get scammed, and too many of them feel embarrassed to ask for help. We built this site so anyone can check — privately, quickly, and without feeling judged.</p>
      <p>Whether it's a suspicious phone call, a weird text message, or an email that doesn't look right, you deserve a simple way to figure out what's going on.</p>

      <h2>What we believe</h2>
      <p><strong>Getting scammed doesn't mean you're gullible.</strong> Scammers are professionals. They study human behavior and use sophisticated techniques. Anyone can be targeted — and checking is always the smart move.</p>
      <p><strong>Asking for help is strength, not weakness.</strong> Whether you use this site, call a family member, or contact your bank — reaching out is the right thing to do.</p>
      <p><strong>"I'm not sure" is a perfectly good reason to check.</strong> You don't need to be certain something is wrong. If something felt off, that's enough.</p>

      <h2>This site is free</h2>
      <p>No ads. No data collection. No newsletter signup. No tracking. Just helpful information when you need it.</p>
      <p>If you found this helpful and want to support it, you can <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">buy me a coffee</a>. But there's absolutely no pressure — helping people avoid scams is the whole point.</p>
