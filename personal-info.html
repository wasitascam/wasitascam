      <p>First, take a breath. This happens to a lot of people, and there are concrete steps you can take right now to protect yourself. Let's go through them together.</p>

      <p><strong>You are not alone, and this is not your fault.</strong> Scammers are professionals. What matters now is taking the right steps — and you're already doing that by being here.</p>

      <h2>If you gave your Social Security Number</h2>
      <ol class="recovery-steps">
        <li>
          <strong>Report it to the FTC.</strong> Go to <a href="https://identitytheft.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IdentityTheft.gov</a> — this is the official government site for identity theft. They'll walk you through a recovery plan.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Place a fraud alert or credit freeze.</strong> Contact any one of the three credit bureaus below — they're required to notify the other two.
          <div class="recovery-contact">
            <strong>Equifax:</strong> 1-800-525-6285<br>
            <strong>Experian:</strong> 1-888-397-3742<br>

        <li>
          <strong>Check your credit reports.</strong> Go to <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> — this is the official free site. Look for accounts or inquiries you don't recognize.

    <section class="recovery-section">
      <h2>If you gave bank account or credit card numbers</h2>
      <ol class="recovery-steps">
        <li>
          <strong>Call your bank or credit card company right away.</strong> Use the phone number on the back of your card — not any number a scammer gave you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ask them to freeze or close the compromised account</strong> and issue you a new card or account number.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Watch your statements.</strong> Keep an eye out for charges you don't recognize over the next several months.
        </li>

    <section class="recovery-section">
      <h2>If you gave login credentials (username or password)</h2>
      <ol class="recovery-steps">
        <li>
          <strong>Change your password right away</strong> on the real website — type the web address yourself, don't click any links from the scam.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>If you use that same password anywhere else, change it there too.</strong> Scammers will try your password on other sites (banks, email, shopping).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Turn on two-factor authentication</strong> if it's available. This adds an extra layer of protection — your bank, email, and many other services offer this. Ask a family member or the company's support line to help you set it up if needed.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div class="important-note">
        <p><strong>What is two-factor authentication?</strong> It means that even if someone has your password, they also need a code sent to your phone to log in. It makes your accounts much harder to break into.</p>

    <section class="recovery-section">
      <h2>If you gave your address, phone number, or other personal details</h2>
      <ol class="recovery-steps">
        <li>
          <strong>Watch out for follow-up scams.</strong> Scammers often share information with each other, so you may get more suspicious calls, texts, or mail.
